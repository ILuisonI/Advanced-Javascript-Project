In this project I used:
HTML, Javascript, CSS, Classes, Bootstrap, JSON.

For this website to work you need live server.

The initial data is taken from an external JSON file.

The project has three views for the pictures:
Cards view, List view, Carousel view.
The carousel view changes pictures every 3 seconds.

As an admin you can edit pictures and delete them.
As a user/admin you can add pictures to your cart.

You can view your cart and remove pictures from your cart.
