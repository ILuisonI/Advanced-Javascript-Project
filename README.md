In this project I used:
HTML, Javascript, CSS, Classes, Bootstrap.

For this website to work you need live server.

The project has three views for the pictures:
Cards view, List view, Carousel view.
The carousel view changes pictures every 3 seconds.

As an admin you can edit pictures and delete them.
As a user you can add pictures to your cart.
